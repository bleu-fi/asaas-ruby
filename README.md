# Asaas Ruby Library [WIP]

This is a fork of [stripe-ruby](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-ruby), and the goal is to adapt it to be usable with [Asaas](https://asaas.com/).

It all is pretty much a work in progress and should be treated as such. Many entities coming from Stripe that are not relevant for Asaas are still in the app and conversely many Asaas entities are missing.

For a more battle-tested library, see <https://github.com/marcosgugs/asaas-ruby>.
